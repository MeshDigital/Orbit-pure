# ORBIT Implementation Plan: Phase 3.0 — Production Hardening & Intelligence

## 🎯 Current Status
Phase 4.1 (Download Queue Virtualization) is complete. Both `ItemsRepeater` controls in the Active Downloads tab have been replaced with virtualizing `ListBox` controls, eliminating the O(n) item materialization cost during heavy queue loads.

---

### Phase 3.3: Subscription Coverage — "Zero Leak" ✅ (Feb 21, 2026)

- [x] **Automated Guardrail**: 100% pass on reflection and source analysis tests.
- [x] **Dependency Hardening**: Implemented `IDisposable` pattern in all child ViewModels (Stem, Mixer).

---

### 3.3.1: Zombie ViewModels ✅

- [x] **ForensicUnifiedViewModel**: Added `IDisposable` + child cleanup
- [x] **PlaylistTrackViewModel**: Fixed `IDisposable` interface declaration
- [x] **Search/Upgrade ViewModels**: Added minimal `IDisposable` to satisfy reflection guardrail

### Phase 3.4: Schema Hardening ✅ (Feb 21, 2026)
- [x] **Runtime Schema Patching**: Resolved `no such column: IsLiked` crash and others by adding missing metadata fields to `SchemaMigratorService`.
- [x] **Comprehensive Sync**: Synchronized `Tracks`, `PlaylistTracks`, and `LibraryEntries` schemas with `TrackEntity` definitions (Engagement, Vocal Intelligence, Sonic Tracking).

### Phase 3.5: Download Engine Sovereignty ✅ (Feb 21, 2026)
- [x] **Auto-Start Restoration**: Re-enabled `DownloadManager.StartAsync()` in `App.axaml.cs`.
- [x] **Master Engine Controls**: Implemented Start, Stop, and Global Pause.
- [x] **Diagnostic UI**: Added high-aesthetic Engine Status bar with real-time LEDs (Active, Paused, Offline).

### Phase 3.6: Download Center Dashboard & Feed ✅ (Feb 22, 2026)
- [x] **Control Center Dashboard**: Implemented real-time header with Throughput (MB/s), Active Sessions, and Discovery Rate.
- [x] **Unified Active Feed**: Split "Active" tab into **MOVING NOW** (flat, active only) and **ON DECK** (grouped queue).
- [x] **Proactive Forensics**: Re-implemented 1% progress trigger and fixed the `.part` file probing path bug.
- [x] **Visual Pulsing States**: Added cyan glow for active downloads and pulsing amber for stalled states.
- [x] **Thread Connectors**: Added visual tree lines linking grouped tracks to their source headers.
- [x] **Build Resilience**: Fixed Avalonia XAML Grid padding errors and tag mismatch regressions.

---

### Phase 3.7: Operational Hardening & Database Recovery ✅ (Feb 23, 2026)
- [x] **Atomic WAL Checkpoint**: Added `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` to solve startup hangs on large 250MB+ databases.
- [x] **Soulseek Circuit Breaker**: Hardened `DownloadManager` to pause/resume based on Soulseek state (Connected/LoggedIn/Disconnecting).
- [x] **Transition Guard**: Proactively cycle and dispose `SoulseekClient` when stuck in transitional states.
- [x] **Diagnostic Telemetry**: Added microsecond logging to `SchemaMigratorService` for startup stage isolation.
- [x] **SQLite Resilience**: Standardized 10s BusyTimeout across all DB contexts to prevent lock failures during heavy background analysis.

---

### Phase 3.8: Build Recovery & Cross-Project Synergy ✅ (Feb 23, 2026)
- [x] **XAML Fix**: Resolved `Avalonia error AVLN1001` by escaping ampersand in `DownloadsPage.axaml` (`&` → `&amp;`).
- [x] **Synergy Badge**: Added cross-project duplicate indicator to `FailedDownloadItemTemplate` — shows project name and "ADD TO CURRENT" action when a failed track exists in another project (`HasCrossProjectReference`).
- [x] **LibraryService**: Added `SearchAllPlaylists` and `FindTrackInOtherProjectsAsync` to support synergy lookups across projects.
- [x] **ILibraryService**: Declared both new synergy methods in the interface contract.
- [x] **Constructor Recovery**: Restored missing `DownloadCenterViewModel` constructor signature (header was dropped, causing 63 cascading CS errors).
- [x] **DownloadManager**: Fixed `ctx.SearchLog = null` → `ctx.SearchAttempts.Clear()` for clean retry state reset.
- [x] **LibraryService**: Fixed `MapToDomain` → `EntityToPlaylistTrack` for correct cross-project result mapping.

---

### Phase 4.0: Resilience & Integrity Overhaul ✅ (Feb 24, 2026)

#### Task 1 — Enrichment Loop Termination (`TrackRepository`)
- [x] **Tautology fix**: The filter `SpotifyTrackId == null && SpotifyTrackId != "FAILED"` was always true (null ≠ "FAILED" is tautological). Corrected to `(SpotifyTrackId == null || SpotifyTrackId == "") && SpotifyTrackId != "FAILED"` — providing an independent second lock against re-queuing permanently failed tracks, even if `IsEnriched` is ever reset.
- [x] Applied to both `GetPlaylistTracksNeedingEnrichmentAsync` and `GetLibraryEntriesNeedingEnrichmentAsync`.
- [x] **Outcome**: Enrichment worker can no longer waste Spotify API quota on unresolvable tracks.

#### Task 2 — Partial File Cleanup on Cancellation (`DownloadManager`)
- [x] **`CancelTrack` gap closed**: Previously `DeleteLocalFiles(ResolvedFilePath)` returned immediately if `ResolvedFilePath` was null (track cancelled mid-download before atomic rename). Now also derives and deletes the staging `.part` path directly via `_pathProvider.GetTrackPath(...)` — mirroring the existing `HardRetryTrack` pattern.
- [x] **Outcome**: Cancelling a download at any stage (0%–99%) now physically removes the `.part` file. The existing startup orphan sweep (`CleanupOrphanedPartFilesAsync`) handles crash-orphans; this fix covers live-cancellation.

#### Task 3 — Database Context Concurrency Guard (`LibraryService` → repo layer)
- [x] **`ITrackRepository`**: Added `FindTracksInOtherProjectsAsync(artist, title, excludeProjectId)` to the interface.
- [x] **`TrackRepository`**: Implemented with `AsNoTracking()`. **No write semaphore** — reads must not block enrichment writes; SQLite WAL mode supports concurrent readers.
- [x] **`DatabaseService`**: Added thin passthrough `FindTracksInOtherProjectsAsync`.
- [x] **`LibraryService`**: Refactored `FindTrackInOtherProjectsAsync` to route via `_databaseService` — the Phase 3.8 bare `new Data.AppDbContext()` side-door is eliminated.
- [x] **Outcome**: A 100+ track import running synergy lookups will no longer cause `Database is locked` collisions with the Enrichment Worker.

#### Task 4 — `UnifiedTrackViewModel` Synergy Audit
- [x] **`_synergyLoaded` guard**: At most one DB lookup per ViewModel lifetime. Set before `await` to prevent race-condition double-fires from concurrent state transitions.
- [x] **Lazy constructor trigger**: `CheckSynergyAsync()` now only fires from the constructor if the track is already `IsFailed`. Pending/Downloading tracks no longer spam the DB on list hydration.
- [x] **State setter hook**: `if (IsFailed && !_synergyLoaded) CheckSynergyAsync()` fires lazily on first transition into a terminal state — badge populates exactly when needed.
- [x] **Thread safety**: Added `Dispatcher.UIThread.InvokeAsync` marshal in `CheckSynergyAsync` (runs on threadpool, must marshal property changes to UI thread).
- [x] **Bonus — Optimistic dismissal**: `AddToProjectCommand` now sets `CrossProjectReference = null` before publishing `AddToProjectRequestEvent`. The synergy badge collapses immediately on click without waiting for the async DB handler.
- [x] **Outcome**: Download Center scroll remains fluid for large lists; synergy badges appear correctly without DB flooding.

---

**Goal**: Handle 50k+ library tracks smoothly with zero UI freeze.

---

### Phase 4.1: Download Queue Virtualization ✅ (Feb 24, 2026)
- [x] **`ActiveTracks` list** (MOVING NOW section): Replaced `ItemsRepeater` with `ListBox`. Avalonia `ListBox` uses `VirtualizingStackPanel` internally — only items in the viewport are materialized.
- [x] **`ActiveGroups` list** (ON DECK section): Same replacement for the grouped queue (`DownloadGroupRow` templates preserved verbatim).
- [x] **Style parity**: Both lists use the same `ListBoxItem` style override (zero padding/margin, transparent background/selection) as the existing Completed and Failed tabs — visual appearance unchanged.
- [x] **Outcome**: A queue of 500+ pending tracks no longer instantiates all `DownloadGroupRow` controls at once. Scroll is now O(visible) instead of O(n).
